# Grocery List Application

This is a grocery list application I worked on for a data structures & algorithms course during my college career. It allows the user to create multiple grocery lists and add products from a suggested list of items that the program provides, or allows them to manually insert a product not yet listed. Purpose of the project is to learn, of course, the structure, use, and time complexity differencies of the data structures.

**Note to self/TODO:** The application may still be improved, such as code readability and some sections may be more organized.
